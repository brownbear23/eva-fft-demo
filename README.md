# FFT Documentation
There is discrepancy between python's np.fft.fft2 function and swift's performFFT function. Same image is used for both functions' inputs and outputs are displayed individually below.


## Python FFT function
np.fft.fft2 function is performed on the left image and output is shown on middle and right images which are fast fourier transform's magnitude and phase.

## Swift FFT function
performFFT function is performed on the left image and output is shown on middle and right images which are fast fourier transform's magnitude and phase.
